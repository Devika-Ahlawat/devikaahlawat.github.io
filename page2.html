<h3> Our cutest protagonist-He is the son of Hiroshi and Misae. His nickname is "Shin-chan" Nohara and he is Himawari's brother, a kindergarten-aged boy whose antics are the basis for the series. He is 5 years old and yet acts overtly mature. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever.</h3>
